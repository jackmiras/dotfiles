## Pull Requests

I welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually takes me around 48 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure the fastest reviewing and addition of your request:
  1. If it's a feature, bugfix, or anything else, please only change code where strictly necessary.
   **DO NOT** do this: Ex: Title "Fixes Crash Related to Bug" but includes other files that were changed without explanation or that weren't related to the bug you fixed. Another example is a non-descriptive title "Fixes Stuff".
  2. Pull requests must be made against ```develop``` branch.
  3. Have fun!
